# Amiga ST samples for Topos / Strudel

This set of audio samples is taken from [this wonderful collection](https://archive.org/details/AmigaSoundtrackerSamplePacksst-xx) of **Ultimate Tracker Amiga samples**. They were initially made by Karsten Obarski. They have been converted using the script in `main.py` to be usable with [Tidal Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/) or [Topos](https://topos.raphaelforment.fr).

These files were processed for use in live coding environments:
- pitched down one octave
- gain down 6db 

The audio has been processed with SoX. The script used to do so is also included in this repository.
