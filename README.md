# Atari ST samples for Topos / Strudel

This set of audio samples is taken from [this wonderful collection](https://archive.org/details/AmigaSoundtrackerSamplePacksst-xx) of Ultimate Tracker Amiga samples. They were initially made by Karsten Obarski. They have been converted using the script in `main.py` to be usable with [Tidal Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/) or [Topos](https://topos.raphaelforment.fr).

- Note that these files are recorded at a very high pitch. This was the norm for cramming as much audio files as possible in limited memory. **Remember to pitch these down when you are playing**.
